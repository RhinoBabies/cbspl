          <p>Cookie Barney Software was founded in 2017 with the idea of creating easy to use and easy to access software to improve the lives of those around us. The team started small and over time grew into a coding machine. PeerLibrary is a solution to avoid spending exorbitant amounts of money for a book that will be used for only a few months. Students will be able to sign up through the website with a username and their campus email address. Once their account is active, they will be able to add their available books to the database, search for books they may need, and begin correspondence with other users about reaching some sort of trade agreement for a textbook.</p>
